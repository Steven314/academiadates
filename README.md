The goal of `{academiadates}` is to extend `{tsibble}` by adding a new
class which is built to assist handling date intervals that are common
in academic institutions, that being three terms annually.

`{lubridate}` has [`quarter()` and
`semester()`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/quarter.html)
methods to access the quarter or semester from a date. This lacks the
functionality for a variable number of periods per year which was
proposed in
[`tidyverse/lubridate#1134`](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate/issues/1134),
but has not received any further work.

`{tsibble}` has support for
[quarters](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/reference/year-quarter.html) in
its ecosystem. It also provides
[scales](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/reference/tsibble-scales.html)
which wrap [ggplot2â€™s date
scales](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_date.html). These
can be seen throughout [*Forecasting: Principles and
Practice*](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos. The
first example of a quarter timescale is in [Figure
1.1](https://otexts.com/fpp3/data-methods.html#data-methods).
